0) What is your workshop about?

The workshop is about using Python's builtin debugger pdb and its extension ipdb.

1) What the workshopâ€™s domain of concern?

Efficient use of debugger for understanding programs' dynamic behavior and finding the root causes of bugs.


2) What kind problem does it solve?

Many developers inspect their running programs with print statements or logging. This works for simple cases but becomes insufficient when more moving parts are involved. A debugger allows to pause a running program, read and change its state, and control the execution flow.

This workshop is a solid hands-on introduction to ipdb, a refresher for those who have used it before, and shows new features specific to Python 3.


3) Why is it important/difficult?

This is important because learning to use a debugger is a one-time investment that helps to fix bugs faster. The speedup comes from a faster feedback loop in testing bug origin theories.

4) What kind of skills will audience learn from the workshop?

This workshop will teach how to start the debugger, control the program flow, and inspect its internal state.


5) Is there any prerequisite knowledge required to attend the workshop?
This workshop assumes a basic knowledge of using Python interactive shell. Participants are welcome to bring laptops and follow along
