0) What is your workshop about?

The workshop is about using Python's builtin debugger PDB and its extension iPDB.

1) What the workshopâ€™s domain of concern?

Efficient use of debugger for understanding programs' dynamic behavior and finding bugs' root causes by going through practical exercises.


2) What kind problem does it solve?

Many developers inspect runtime state of their programs using print statements or logging. This approach works for simple cases but becomes insufficient with more moving parts. A debugger allows to get inside a running program, read and change its state and have a faster feedback loop in testing bug origin theories. This workshop aims to be a solid practical introduction for those new to debugging and act as a refresher for those who have used it before.


3) Why is it important/difficult?

This is important because learning to use a debugger once saves time.

4) What kind of skills will audience learn from the workshop?


5) Is there any prerequisite knowledge required to attend the workshop?



You can also send us a short bio (max 2 sentence) if you want that to be published in the program together with your workshop!
